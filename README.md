# Hi, I'm Crist√≥bal Contreras Rubio üëã

I'm a **"problem solver"** by nature, always looking for creative and efficient solutions to any challenge that comes my way.

My passion is **solving problems**, especially in the world of **IoT**. From creating **MVPs**, **PoCs**, to functional prototypes, I'm always on the lookout for new ideas to bring things to life.

I also have a **strong product design vision**, which allows me to ensure that the solutions I create not only work but also provide an intuitive and well-thought-out user experience.

## What I Do

- üöÄ **Lead IoT projects** from conception to execution.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Build MVPs, PoCs, and prototypes** to quickly test ideas.
- üí° **Design products** with a user-centric perspective.

## Tools I Use
